xcommits is a CLI app that helps you autmomate your commits to githup. Each 20 minutes (haven't decided yet), the app takes an automate snapchot of files, commits and pushes them into your remote repository in github (feature-branch). It's following two time management techniques such as: Pomodoro and Scrum to help improve efficiency of any developper. Each automated commits is saved in this format:

- Round#01_2021-04-11_16:48:09.c
- Round#03_2021-04-11_16:49:36.rb

I'm still working on the basics of the CLI.

xcommits is a script that helps you autmomate your commits in githup. Each 20 minutes, the app takes an automate snapchot of the files, commit and push them into your remote repository in github (feature-branch). It's following two time management techniques such as: Pomodoro and Scrum to help improve efficiency of any developper. Each automated commits is saved in this format:

Round#01_2021-04-11_16:48:09.c
Round#03_2021-04-11_16:49:36.rb

I'm still working on the basics of the CLI.
